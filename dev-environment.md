## Development Environments

You will need to create a "development environment" to complete the homework
assignments and the class project in this class. By "development environment" I
mean a setup on a computer such that you can write code, run code, and use
version control. We'll be writing Go, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll be using
Git for version control.

Your development environment can either be
a 
[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/Cloud9/) environment
provided by the instructor (including the cost 😉)
or
your
personal computer.
There are trade-offs between these. Setting up your
personal computer is a wonderful learning experience. However, it can be 
sometimes be challenging. 

Below, you will find documentation on how to get
started on Cloud9, mac, and windows. **Unless you are
feeling self-assured, we recommend you use Cloud9 during the
Fall 2021 semester because, with social distancing it 
will be difficult for us to troubleshoot problems you
encounter on your local computer.) The options are mutually
exclusive: if you're using Cloud9, you don't need to follow
the instructions for Mac or Windows and vice versa.

### Cloud9

1. Checkout your Dashboard on the [class website](http://656.mba). Therein
   you should see login credentials for Cloud9. You'll need to supply an
   account number, username, and password. All that is in your dashboard
   under the "user secrets" section.
3. Now you're all set. Your Cloud9 environment uses
   [Amazon Linux](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/). You have
   git already installed and, clearly, Cloud9 has a built-in code editor.

Here are some helpful videos related to Cloud9:

* [How to log into Cloud9](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.656.mba/Cloud9-intro.mp4).
  (That was recorded last year, so some of the offhand remarks might 
  not apply to this semester).
* How to navigate around on the shell. This shows the basic commands you'll need
  again and again. TODO: add video
* How to kill programs on Cloud9 (and run them, to a lesser extent). TODO: add video.

### Mac

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Install git. It is likely git is already installed on your
   mac. Open your terminal and type `git --version`.  If you
   see version information, you've got git. If you see 
   "command not found" or similar, you don't.
   You might also be prompted to install the Mac OSX Command
   Line tools. If you are prompted to do so, you should install
   them, then you'll have git. (See [this guide](https://hackernoon.com/install-git-on-mac-a884f0c9d32c).)
   To install git,
   follow [these instructions](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
   or [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
   You might also like the [GitHub git GUI](https://desktop.github.com/),
   but you should use it as a complement instead of replacement
   for the command line.
3. Install a code editor. I like
   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
   [Atom](https://atom.io/) but you can use anything.

### Windows

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Install git. Follow
   [these instructions](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
   or [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
   TODO: SOMEBODY HELP ME HERE PLEASE. SHOULD THEY INSTALL 
   GITBASH, GITHUB'S DESKTOP CLIENT AND POWERSHELL GIT INTEGRATION,
   OR USE THE LINUX SUBSYSTEM?
3. Install a code editor. I like
   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
   [Atom](https://atom.io/) but you can use anything.
