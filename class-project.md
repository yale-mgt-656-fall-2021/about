# The class project

## General description

You will work together
on a class project: a web application for posting events and RSVPing
for those events, similar to Eventbrite (but way worse). The class project is
divided into separate scrum "[sprints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29#Sprint)", each one week long. In each
sprint there is a product manager and the rest of the team will act
as developers. Each sprint will have a different project manager,
who is responsible for writing the progress report. The developers
are responsible for writing code. The project will be evaluated in
two ways. First, the management of the project will be graded based
on the sprint progress reports. Second, the technical progress of
the project will be measured in an automated fashion: software written
by the instructors will, every day, test the behavior of your
application to see what fraction of the specifications have been
completed.

Teams maybe *four or five persons* in size.

## Project grading

The project will be graded in five separate parts: four sprint reports
and one final report. The project reports are short, perhaps 2-3 pages,
and they detail the progress the team is making. The final report
grade includes two components, the "regular report" grade and the
grade from the automated tests. The automated tests will quantify the
degree to which your website (the Eventbrite clone) conforms to our
specifications. This code will be made available to you before you
begin the project.

All students on the same team will receive an identical grade for
each of the project-related assignments.

## MGT660 differences

If you're in MGT660, you'll have extra requirements. Those will
likely include a database backend, testing, some kind of continuous
delivery pipeline, and decent code quality. You know, it will need
to be a _real_ product ðŸ¤£.

## More to come...

I will be changing the class project during the semester. What you
read here is incomplete. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
