# Sprint report guidelines

WARNING: this is a work in progress.

Our class project features week-long sprints. This is shorter
than you'd find in professional practice. At the end of each
sprint, we ask that you submit to us ("management") a short
report.

This document describes the report grading rubric and also
will be updated weekly with class-wide feedback on the
sprint reports.

## Grading Rubic

The grading rubric shown below is _roughly_ what the teaching
staff will use to grade your report. We may change the rubric each
week, though we are likely to do so only marginally.

- Team info (3 = full credit)
  - Nicknames
  - Team name
- Assignment info (3 = full credit)
  - Sprint report number 2
  - Date due
- Burndown (8 = full credit, 10 = exceptional)
  - Makes sense
  - Time axis covers only the past and not the future:
    it is not a prediction)
  - Burn down is roughly consistent git commit history
  - Burn down is roughly consistent with backlog and previous reports
  - Axes are labeled
  - Inconsistencies mentioned
  - You don't have to burn down to zero
  - Rubric notes:
    - 3 = no chart, but a description in prose
    - 5 = Used stories instead of story points in the y-axis
- Completed Stories (8 = full credit. 10 = exceptional)
  - Show what was done this Sprint
  - Indicates stories that are new or that failed the acceptance criteria (likely just an eyeball criteria for most teams)
  - Rubric notes
    - 5 = stories w/ no points
- Narrative (8 = full credit. 10 = exceptional)
  - Describes what happened this week
  - What meetings?
  - What challenges?
  - Other relevant info for "management", e.g. comments from your sprint retrospectives
- Project Backlog (4 = full credit. 5 = exceptional)
  - Should show all the stories. For full credit, it will show their title, story point estimation, acceptance criteria, and priority.
  - Does not need to show story details, tags, labels or other information for full credit.
  - If you're using a tool like GitHub Projects and its not easy to export these in text format, a link to a screenshot of your prioritized and estimated product backlog will suffice. (Of course, you don't want to link to the live version because it will be changing. We want a snapshot of it at time of the report.) This is preferable to us because we don't want to create extra work for you: we just want an indication of how the project is coming along.
  - Rubric notes:
    - 3 = Backlog missing point estimations
- Clarity (3 = full credit, 5 = exceptional)
  - Includes the quality of layout, prose, charts, and other elements that make the report easy to understand.
- HTML (extra credit, 2)
  - The report is written in HTML, instead of Word, Google Docs, etc.
- InApp (extra credit, 1)
  - The report is part of your application
- Version Control (extra credit, 1)
  - The report is under version control. This can be implied by
    where it is hosted or indicated explicitly.
  - Note: there is a high correlation among these last three criteria.
- Traffic sources (Final report only, total = 10)
  - 10 - right sources, right order, approximately right fractions
  - 9 - right sources, order is off by one, approximately right fractions OR right sources, one is missing, approximately right fractions
  - 7 - right sources, wrong order OR right order, missing sources
  - 5 - tracking is present but wrong (i.e. analytics shows basically no visitors or percentages aren't mentioned)
  - If total is less than 10, +1 for mentioning if support/donate was more successful

## General feedback and guidance

- We really do not want these to be extra work for you. Our goal is to understand the status of the project, not to make you report for reporting's sake.
- Bullets are great.
- Please use nicknames instead of real names in sprint reports. Please drop emails. I'm sorry I included these in the example document
- Please show us your story point estimations!
- There is not a 1-to-1 correspondence between the selenium/chromedriver tests and the stories in your product backlog. Some stories will make many tests pass, others will make no tests pass.
- Make sure you use story points rather than number of stories in your sprint burndown (or burnup) charts. `You can create burndowns with ease if you are using ZenHub. See https://www.zenhub.com/guides/burndown-charts
- Your stories should, to the extent possible, exhibit the INVEST criteria: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)
- If you have any of the Scrum meetings (sprint planning, stand-up, demo, and retrospective), please mention that. These will contribute to the "narrative" and "clarity" measures. We don't put much weight on them because we know your schedules likely preclude a full Scrum schedule.
