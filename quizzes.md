# Quizzes

Most classes are preceded by a short quiz. The quizzes will be
completed online _prior_ to the lectures. They usually consist of
multiple choice questions that test whether 1) the student completed
the assigned readings and video lectures; and, 2) understood the
most important concepts. Each quiz is timed: students have 15 minutes
to complete them once they are started. The nature of the questions
on the quizzes will vary. Some questions are simple and factual,
some test understanding, others require synthesis or research. You
take the quizzes through the class website.

I believe in pre-class quizzes and students in my previous classes indicated
that they were highly satisfied with the quizzing practices. Further, there is sound
empirical evidence that the [testing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect)
increases your understanding and retention of material.
I believe the strongest arguments, from your perspective as a student, for frequent quizzes are as follows:

- they give you a small reward for coming to class prepared;
- they eliminate the need for cold calling, which creates a better classroom atmosphere;
- they ensure that your classmates are better prepared for class and therefore more fun to speak with;
- they are short, and you can drop your lowest scores, so they are not stressful;
- they allow you to accumulate your grade gradually throughout the semester, instead of relying on large exams (there are still exams in class, but their worth less than they'd be without quizzes);
- they allow you to develop a grade that is independent from your group project;
- they give us the freedom to use class for more enjoyable activities, confident that we all have a shared body of knowledge.

## Taking quizzes

Most of the class meetings include pre-class reading and a
quiz that covers that reading. You will take those quizzes
either via your class website (http://656.mba or http://660.mba)
or using the class API. For each meeting of our class,
quiz information is provided on the class website.
That information changes appearance
depending on the state of the quiz. A button that says
"Begin Quiz" will appear if you can take the the quiz.

In this semester, each quiz has a
duration of 15 minutes. Once you begin a quiz, you can change
your answers until either 15 minutes after you began the
quiz, or the closing time of the quiz, which is usually the
beginning of class. So, if you start a quiz five minutes
prior to class, you will only have five minutes to submit
the answers to the quiz questions! The quizzes are graded
only after the quiz closes. Kyle will go over the content
of the quizzes at the beginning of class.

You can take the quiz if all of the following are true:

- The quiz is not labeled as "draft". Draft means the teaching
  staff are still working on the quiz questions.
- The current time is after the quiz is "open". Quizzes usually
  open five days before the meeting/lecture to which the quiz
  corresponds.
- The current time is not after the quiz is "closed". Quizzes
  usually close when the meeting/lecture to which the quiz
  corresponds begins.
- You did not previously take the quiz or you already started
  the quiz, but your time to take the quiz is not expired.
  All quizzes this semester will last 20 minutes.

Once you click "Begin Quiz", you will see a list of multiple
choice questions displayed in an HTML form. For each question,
you should select the options you desire and then click
"Save Answers" at the bottom of the page. Unless there is an
error, the options that you selected will be labeled as "saved",
so that you have visual confirmation.

## Notes about the quizzes

* The quiz questions are not uniformly drawn from material in
  the pre-class reading. Some pre-class reading will be over-represented
  and some under-represented either, usually because of heterogeous
  importance of the pre-class reading material.
* We want the quiz questions to test your conceptual understanding.
  We do not want to ask "gotcha" questions or simple recall questions.
  However, we will fall short in those aspirations often.
* Some quiz questions will have obvious answers. We do this in part
  to remind you of important concepts.
* If you feel like a quiz questions is unfair or that the answer
  is wrong, please tell Kyle. It is easy for Kyle to "fix" a bad
  question.
* Questions that have multiple correct answers are indicated as
  such in the class website.
* There is a timer at the bottom of the page in the quiz UI on 
  the class website. It shows the *approximate* time you have left
  to finish your quiz. Please monitor your time.
* It is 100% fine to google for the answers to quiz questions or to
  look in the reading material. You may not rely on another human
  being for real-time support on the quiz and you may not share
  information about the quiz with other students.

## Submitting a quiz using the class API

Most people will want to use the class website. If you are a
masochist, you may wish to use the API. If you wish to do so,
please contact me (Kyle)---I'd enjoy showing you how.
