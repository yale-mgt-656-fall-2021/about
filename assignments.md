# Assignments

## About the assignments

The class assignments partition into two sets: skill building
assignments that are completed individually, and a class project
that is completed in a small team employing your new technical and
management skills.

In the skill building homework assignments, you will develop an
understanding of the various technologies used to build user-facing
web applications, particularly [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5),
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript),
[CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets),
[Golang](http://golang.org),
and
[git](http://git-scm.com/). You will also familiarize yourself with
various services that we will use during the semester including
[GitHub](https://github.com/), [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), and
potentially
[Cloud9](https://c9.io/). These assignments will be completed
individually and will be submitted through the class website.

## Assignment instructions

On the class website (http://656.mba) there is an "Assignments" link. From there, you
can browse individual assignments including instructions for completing
and submitting each assignment. (The class website is often down until the semester begins.)

## Submitting through the class website

You can submit each of the assignments through your class website.
However, assignments can only be submitted if 1) they are not labeled
as "draft"; and, 2) the current time is before the assignment is
"closed" (or due). With rare exception, assignments will require
you to submit one or more "fields"---a URL, some text, etc. Most
often, these will be URLs pointing to web applications that you build
online and your Git repositories on GitHub. After the assignment is
closed (due), the instructors will grade the assignment using the
information you submitted.

When you submit your assignment, please take care that you submit
the correct information without typos. The class website will happily
suggest "foo.com" as your submission instead of the URL to your Git repo.
Many of the assignments will be graded in an automated fashion and
so a typo can have a catastrophic effect on your grade for an assignment.

For many assignments I will provide either automated testing code
or testing code online at [https://grading.656.mba]. You can use
these tools to make sure your software is working how you expect.

## Submitting through the class API

If you want to use the class API instead of the website, please
see me and I'll describe how to do so.

## Other thoughts

- Unlike quizzes, there is no timer once you start an assignment submission. You just
  need to get it in before the assignment is due ("closes_at" in the assignment API).
- Some assignments will have multiple fields. Though, many will just require a git repo
  where we can find our code. If you created that repo using one of the GitHub Classroom
  invites that we often use, then the teaching staff will have the read permissions
  needed to grade your assignment submission.
- Later in the semester, many of the assignments are team submissions. In those cases,
  you'll create an assignment submission using your team nickname instead of your user id.
  And, all team members will have read/write access to those assignments. With individual
  assignments, you have read/write only to your own assignment submissions.
