## Grading

The course includes homework assignments, quizzes, a group project,
exams, and participation. These are the only works upon which
students are graded.

Grades will be awarded as **roughly** as indicated below. This
distribution **will definitely change** over the course of the
semester: we will skip certain quizzes, certain assignments may
become worth more or less, assignments may be added, and generally,
the instructors will be constantly tweaking our class to maximize
our learning and enjoyment. At the end of the semester, we suspect
the grades will be roughly as indicated below.

In addition, there will be roughly 20 quizzes, each worth about 13 points.
Therefore, the total number of points in the class is roughly 1165.

**PLEASE NOTICE** the following. First, the "closed_at" dates (due dates)
shown above is not authoritative
and should not be used for planning your semester. The due dates could
change and so you ought to refer to the class website, instead of
the table above. Second, the "is_team" column is a boolean that has the value true
(t) when an assignment is submitted and graded once per team. On those
assignments, each team member will received an identical score.
Finally, there is no final exam.

Participation is graded on a per-class basis and can be one
of the following values: 'absent', 'attended', 'contributed', or 'led'.
If you
attend all classes during the semester, you should receive
roughly 50% of the participation component for the course.
These are worth 0, 2.5, 3.5, and 5 points, respectively. Your
maximum participation grade will be roughly 150pts. Because it is
impossible to accumulate 150 points in our 26 class meetings,
we will be curving the participation grades: the person with
the maximum participation grade will receive 150pts and all
other student grades will be scaled proportionately.

Letter grades will be assigned at the end of the course based
on the official Yale grading policies which are available from
the Yale SOM registrar. In general, each school at Yale has its
own grading scale: Yale College is different than the Divinity
School which is different than SOM. To compute final grades,
the instructor will rank order students and then determine
the break point for each scale: where the Yale College A/A-
break point is, where the HP/P boundary is, etc. Some schools,
such as SOM, have a forced curve. That same curve does not apply
to the grade distribution of students from other schools.
The students enrolled in MGT656 and MGT660 will be graded independently.
If you
have concerns about grading, please see the instructor.
