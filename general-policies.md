# General policies

## Lectures

This course often uses a [flipped
classroom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom), meaning
that you will learn a great deal of material prior to class and our
time in the classroom, together is spent

- summarizing the most important points;
- discussing the material; and,
- applying the material through activities, homework, or the class project.

Nearly every lecture has a set of required readings that you
will need to complete before class. Often, those readings will
include videos. After completing the
readings and prior to class, you will complete a short quiz
online (see below for more details) and also submit questions
via our Q&A system (more below also).

Class meetings are 80 minutes long.
In class, we will typically have
a "mini-lecture" and discussion through which we will recapitulate the
most important points of the readings. In most meetings, we will also
have some "activity". This
may include discussing your semester project or a guest speaker.

In the Fall 2020 semester, I'm going to try to make our activities 
equally good for those joining in-person and online. Likely that will
mean those joining in-person will have their laptops open and will
interact virtually in addition to verbally.

### Quizzes

Most classes are preceded by a short quiz. The quizzes will be
completed online _prior_ to the lectures. They usually consist of
multiple choice questions that test whether 1) the student completed
the assigned readings and video lectures; and, 2) understood the
most important concepts. Each quiz is timed: students have 15 minutes
to complete them once they are started. The nature of the questions
on the quizzes will vary. Some questions are simple and factual,
some test understanding, others require synthesis or research. You
take the quizzes through the class website.

I believe in pre-class quizzes and students in my previous classes indicated
that they were highly satisfied with the quizzing practices. Further, there is sound
empirical evidence that the [testing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect)
increases your understanding and retention of material.
I believe the strongest arguments, from your perspective as a student, for frequent quizzes are as follows:

- they give you a small reward for coming to class prepared;
- they eliminate the need for cold calling, which creates a better classroom atmosphere;
- they ensure that your classmates are better prepared for class and therefore more fun to speak with;
- they are short, and you can drop your lowest scores, so they are not stressful;
- they allow you to accumulate your grade gradually throughout the semester, instead of relying on large exams (there are still exams in class, but their worth less than they'd be without quizzes);
- they allow you to develop a grade that is independent from your group project;
- they give us the freedom to use class for more enjoyable activities, confident that we all have a shared body of knowledge.

### Participation

Your participation in class improves the learning experience
for everybody: me, your colleagues, and yourself. Participation
is [recorded](https://github.com/kljensen/yelukerest/blob/master/db/src/data/yeluke/engagement.sql) on a per-class basis by the teaching staff.
See the
[grading notes](grading.md) for more information.

If you wish, you may complete an extra assignment in lieu of
participation. Please discuss this option with the instructor.

### The class project

See the [class project](class-project.md) section.

## Compromises

We would like to share with you some of the rationale for decisions we made
in designing the class project, with a focus on the compromises.

TODO: fill this in ;P.

## Textbook

There is no textbook for the course. Readings will on Canvas or otherwise
online.

## Diversity, equity, inclusion and their opposites

This class will be an inclusive environment. If you see behavior
that you feel is discriminatory, _particularly_ from the professor
or teaching staff, we encourage you to avail yourself of one or
more of the following resources.

### Use of "master" in git repositories

The default branch in git (and on GitHub) is, by convention, called the
"master" branch. Many developers are trying to use a different default
branch name because of the etymological ties of the term "master" and the
abhorrent practice of slavery.
You can read more about this
movement [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955),
[here](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-knodel-terminology-00.html#rfc.section.1.1),
and
[here](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/474419/does-the-term-master-in-git-the-vc-system-refer-to-slavery).
All of the repositories in this class use the default "master" name.
(There's no concept of a "slave" branch in git, though there was such
a thing [in one of git's predecessors](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html).
I hope by next year to move everything to a different default name.

## Special needs

If you have special needs in the course, please contact
the instructor. For example, you should contact the instructor
in any of the following circumstances: you wish to miss class
due to religious observation; you have a disability that
makes participation in class difficult (e.g. an injury or
visual impairment that makes a written exam an inaccurate
assessment of your knowledge); or, you require particular
seating arrangements in order to better learn. Please check 
the [Yale student accessibility services](https://sas.yale.edu/faculty/online-courses-and-covid-19-response) for more information, particularly
covid-related information.
