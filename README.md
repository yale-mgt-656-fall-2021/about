Students in this course will learn how to manage software development teams through the process of building a basic web application. We will discuss “[agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)”, [continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery), “[devops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)”, and related management practices. Along the way, students will acquire elementary software development skills for creating consumer web applications including both front-end development (typically
[HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5),
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), &
[CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets))
and back-end development (typically Google’s Go language). The coursework in MGT656 typically includes homework (mostly programming assignments completed individually), pre-class quizzes, in-class exams, and a group final project. Some experience programming is beneficial, though not necessary for the motivated student. The course is open to all Yale students. In some semesters MGT660 is offered as an advanced version of this course. For more information, see the class website at http://656.mba (offline between semesters).

Usually, 656 has about 65 students. Most spots
are reserved for students enrolled in the Yale School of Management.
These students may bid on the course using the SOM bidding system.
The remaining spots in the course are open to the non-SOM students,
including Yale College, who may shop the course. (In the case of
excess demand, the best performing students shopping will be invited
to stay in the course. Performance will be measured by a mix of
attendance and grades on assignments. If demand exceeds capacity,
I will make an announcement in class providing more details.)
Officially registering for Yale College students will require a
form that is signed by your dean and Kyle Jensen. You can print
these forms online (somewhere).


NOTE: in the Fall of 2020 656 will only be open to SOM students.

Yale SOM is doing its utmost to ensure you, students, have the best
possible experience this fall. 

Many details are still "up in the air" as I am writing this document.
You should refer to official lines of communication (instead of
this document) for major policies. I believe that we're going to have
"mixed mode" whereby we will be meeting in a socially distanced fashion
in class and each time we meet, some us will be able to attend in person
and others will be required to join electronically. It's not entirely
clear right now.

What is clear is that SOM is committed, and I am committed, to ensuring
you learn as much as you can. I'm working on structuring the class so
that I find acceptable substitutes for the normally numerous activities
we do in class that cannot be done in a socially distanced fashion.

Please take a moment to review the
[student accessibility services](https://sas.yale.edu/faculty/online-courses-and-covid-19-response) information about COVID-19. If you have accessibility needs, please let me know
so that I can meet them!

## Course Philosophy

If you are interested in software and technology, we think this
will be one of the best courses you take at Yale. We designed
the course with the following values.

- **You will actually write code**. If you are going to manage developers,
  you need to understand what it is like to write code. You need to
  speak their language, understand their struggles, understand how tech
  products are built, and understand some fundamentals of computer science.

- **You will use modern best-practices for managing software development**.
  There are many ways in which one can organize
  software development teams. We will teach you
  "[scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29)",
  a popular
  take on agile software development methods. If you go on to be a
  product manager at a major technology company&mdash;Google, Apple,
  Microsoft, etc.&mdash;you will most likely employ some variant of scrum.

- **You will use a modern technology stack, working on both the client
  and server side**.
  On the client side we will use web technologies
  including [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5),
  [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), and
  [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). Delivering software via the
  web is a common choice because browsers are ubiquitous: they exist
  on every phone, tablet, laptop, and computer. On the server side we
  will use [Go](https://golang.org/), a programming language developed
  by Google. Go is a popular, "modern" alternative to
  nodejs, python, and ruby for web application development. Like all
  languages, it is imperfect. It's a reasonable choice for this course.

These are bold goals and challenging to accomplish in the brief time
allotted to us. Our greatest concern is that the technology component
will be a barrier for some students. To ensure that this is not the
case, we will record numerous videos in which the instructors show how
to complete the homework and class project.
In these videos, we discuss the
different ways in which technical goals can be achieved, explicitly
show how to write the code you need, and how to use the different
services we are employing. You will get real experience
with real modern web technologies. That experience should be
pleasurable, hands-on, and minimally frustrating.

## Sections

The class information and policies are divided into the
following sections.

- [Faculty & TA (staff) contact info](staff-contact.md)
- [Office hours](office-hours.md)
- [Grading](grading.md)
- [General policies](general-policies.md)
- [Class project](class-project.md)
- [Quizzes (why we have them and how to submit them)](quizzes.md)
- [Assignment submission](assignments.md)
- [Setting up your development environment](dev-environment.md)

## How to use this document/repo

Because our class info and policies are tracked using
git, you can see if and how they change over the course
of the semester. Further, you have the ability to make
changes yourself---please send me a pull request. Similarly,
if you feel these documents are lacking, please open an
"issue" on GitHub for this repo and we'll address the
issue. Finally, because our git repo is hosted on GitHub, you
can easily receive push notifications of changes to this repo. (Woot!)
