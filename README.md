Students in this course will learn how to manage software development teams
through the process of building a basic web application. We will discuss
“[agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)”,
[continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery),
“[devops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)”, and related management
practices. Along the way, students will acquire elementary software development
skills for creating consumer web applications including both front-end
development (typically [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5),
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), &
[CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)) and back-end
development (typically Google’s Go language). The coursework in MGT656
typically includes homework (mostly programming assignments completed
individually), pre-class quizzes, in-class exams, and a group final project.
Some experience programming is beneficial, though not necessary for the
motivated student. The course is open to all Yale students. In some semesters
MGT660 is offered as an advanced version of this course. For more information,
see the class website at http://656.mba (offline between semesters).

Usually, 656 has about 60 students. Most spots
are reserved for students enrolled in the Yale School of Management.
These students may bid on the course using the SOM bidding system.
The remaining spots in the course are open to the non-SOM students,
including Yale College, who may shop the course. (In the case of
excess demand, the best performing students shopping will be invited
to stay in the course. Performance will be measured by a mix of
attendance and grades on assignments. If demand exceeds capacity,
I will make an announcement in class providing more details. If you're 
not in SOM, see [this guide](https://portal.som.yale.edu/page/for-non-som-yale-students)
for adding the course.)
Officially registering for Yale College students will require a
form that is signed by your dean and Kyle Jensen. You can print
these forms online (somewhere).


## <a name="covid"></a>Covid dystopia clusterfarce 2019/2020/2021

Yale SOM is doing its utmost to ensure you, students, have the best
possible experience this fall. 

Many details are still "up in the air" as I am writing this document.
You should refer to official lines of communication (instead of
this document) for major policies. I believe that we're going to 
be in person and, though not socially-distanced, we will don masks.
Classes will be recorded and also live streamed on zoom. But, unless
there's a big number of people on zoom, I'm not going to be paying
much attention to zoom. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Course Philosophy

If you are interested in software and technology, we think this
will be one of the best courses you take at Yale. We designed
the course with the following values.

- **You will actually write code**. If you are going to manage developers,
  you need to understand what it is like to write code. You need to
  speak their language, understand their struggles, understand how tech
  products are built, and understand some fundamentals of computer science.

- **You will use modern best-practices for managing software development**.
  There are many ways in which one can organize
  software development teams. We will teach you
  "[scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29)",
  a popular
  take on agile software development methods. If you go on to be a
  product manager at a major technology company&mdash;Google, Apple,
  Microsoft, etc.&mdash;you will most likely employ some variant of scrum.

- **You will use a modern technology stack, working on both the client
  and server side**.
  On the client side we will use web technologies
  including [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5),
  [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), and
  [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). Delivering software via the
  web is a common choice because browsers are ubiquitous: they exist
  on every phone, tablet, laptop, and computer. On the server side we
  will use [Go](https://golang.org/), a programming language developed
  by Google. Go is a popular, "modern" alternative to
  nodejs, python, and ruby for web application development. Like all
  languages, it is imperfect. It's a reasonable choice for this course.

These are bold goals and challenging to accomplish in the brief time allotted
to us. Our greatest concern is that the technology component will be a barrier
for some students. To ensure that this is not the case, we will record numerous
videos in which the instructors show how to complete the homework and class
project.  In these videos, we discuss the different ways in which technical
goals can be achieved, explicitly show how to write the code you need, and how
to use the different services we are employing. You will get real experience
with real modern web technologies. That experience should be pleasurable,
hands-on, and minimally frustrating.

## Sections

The class information and policies are divided into the
following sections.

- [Faculty & TA (staff) contact info](staff-contact.md)
- [Office hours](office-hours.md)
- [Grading](grading.md)
- [General policies](general-policies.md)
- [Class project](class-project.md)
- [Quizzes (why we have them and how to submit them)](quizzes.md)
- [Assignment submission](assignments.md)
- [Setting up your development environment](dev-environment.md)

## How to use this document/repo

Because our class info and policies are tracked using git, you can see if and
how they change over the course of the semester. Further, you have the ability
to make changes yourself---please send me a pull request. Similarly, if you
feel these documents are lacking, please open an "issue" on GitHub for this
repo and we'll address the issue. Finally, because our git repo is hosted on
GitHub, you can easily receive push notifications of changes to this repo.
(Woot!)
